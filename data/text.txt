Starting out, we used fourteen features for the first version of our model. Of those fourteen, seven dummy variables were encoded for the countries in our sample data. Due to mutlicolinearity discovered between patents granted, patents in force, and combined education expenditure total, the number of features was reduced to eleven. With the eleven features, we created a model that had Adjusted-R value for the model is at a .993, but had a very high Condition Number of 1.08e+05.  

Another version of the model was created with the non dummy variable features standardized (mean of the feature subtracted from the value and then didved by the standard deviation of the feature) . Even though the Adjusted-R value for the standardized model is at a .993 and had a lower Condition Number of 192, the p-values suggest that we can not reject the null hypothesis for all of the independent variables except for Norway. 

We believe that taking the data through a polynimal transformation would improve the model, but we were unable to run a polynomial regression due to time contraints. For the future state of this analysis, we will enlarge the sample data and use the PloynomialFeature librabry in the sklearn package to perform a polynomial regression.
